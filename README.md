# Tic Tac Toe (Web)

A small, self-contained web-based Tic Tac Toe game.

Features:
- Two-player local mode (play on same screen).
- Play vs Computer mode with an unbeatable AI (minimax).
- Simple, responsive UI. Open in any modern browser.

How to run:
1. Download or clone the files.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.

Files:
- index.html — UI and markup.
- styles.css — styling.
- script.js — game logic and AI.
- README.md — this file.

Ideas for next improvements:
- Add a scoreboard (persisted in localStorage).
- Allow choosing which side (X or O) the player uses.
- Add animations and sound effects.
- Make multiplayer over the network.

Enjoy! If you want, I can:
- add a scoreboard,
- make the AI difficulty adjustable,
- or convert this into a small React/Vue app for easier extension.
